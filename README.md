# Ebola Outbreak Data

Trying to get a repo with a consistent source of Ebola related data. For now I'm getting the data from The World Health Organizations situation reports which are only available in PDFs which you can find here:

http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/situation-reports/en/

For consistency I'll be updating the repo at least once every 18 days or as soon as the data becomes available.

### Help Wanted

I would love to include country data and other sources but I just don't have the time. If you want to help file an issue or pull request and I'll add you as a contributer.
