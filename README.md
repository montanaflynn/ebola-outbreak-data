# Ebola Outbreak Data

Trying to get a repo with a consistent source of Ebola related data. For now I'm getting the data from The World Health Organizations reports which are only available in PDFs which you can find here:

### Help Needed

As you can see I'm missing the death counts. I would also like to include individual country data as well as other sources but I don't have the time to do it all by myself. If you want to help file an issue or send a pull request and I'll add you as a contributer.
