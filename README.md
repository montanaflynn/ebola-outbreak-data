# Ebola Outbreak Data

Trying to get a repo with a consistent source of Ebola related data in various formats. For now I'm getting the data from The World Health Organizations reports which you can find here:

### Help Needed

I would like to include individual country data as well as other sources but I don't have the time to do it by myself. If you want to help file an issue or send a pull request and I'll add you as a contributer. Please also consider donating to the [Ebola Epidemic Relief Fund](http://www.globalgiving.org/projects/ebola-epidemic-relief-fund/) or any other charity fighting the virus in Africa.
