# Ebola Outbreak Data

Trying to get a repo with a consistent source of Ebola related data in various formats. For now I'm getting the data from The World Health Organizations reports which are only available in PDFs which you can find here:

### Help Needed

I would like to include individual country data as well as other sources but I don't have the time to do it by myself. If you want to help file an issue or send a pull request and I'll add you as a contributer.
